	<h2 id = "q1" class = "tp-header">What if my insurance company didn’t pay enough to repair my car?</h2>

	<p>This is very common (more common than it should be). Once you receive your
	
	insurance estimate, Dent Control will perform a detailed estimate and call your
	
	insurance company to discuss what they missed. We will negotiate with your
	
	insurance adjuster to get a fair amount of money to repair your car the RIGHT way.</p>
	
	<a href = "#top-faq"><p>Back to Questions</p></a>

	<h2 id = "q2"  class = "tp-header">Why we don’t do estimates for hail damage:</h2>

	<p>Insurance companies rarely take the time to do a detailed estimate. In our experience, they look at

	your vehicle for less than 5 minutes, then write it up with little to no detail. <a href = "our-process/#process-target">Review our Estimate

	Process</a> and you will understand the difference.</p>
	
	<a href = "#top-faq"><p>Back to Questions</p></a>
	

	<h2 id = "q3"  class = "tp-header">What is a supplement?</h2>

	<p>A supplement is a request to the insurance company for additional money to
	
	properly repair your vehicle. The insurance initial estimates are just that – an
	
	estimated cost to repair. Dent Control spends a significant amount of time
	
	estimating your vehicle to ensure that we don’t miss anything and repair all damage.
	
	When our estimate exceeds the insurance estimate, we contact them to show them
	
	what they missed. The additional amount is the supplement. Also, if there’s
	
	additional damage found during the repair of your vehicle, an additional supplement
	
	is occasionally needed. Dent Control handles it all for you.</p>

	<h2 id = "q4" class = "tp-header">What is a deductible?</h2>

	<p>A deductible is the insured person’s portion of the cost of repairs. It’s the amount of

	money you have to pay toward the repairs before your insurance company covers

	the rest. See the below example:<br>

	$1500 Total Repair Cost<br>

	$500 Deductible (customer pays this amount directly to the repair facility)<br>

	$1000 – Insurance pays this amount. They “deduct” the amount of your deductible<br>

	and pay the rest of the repairs.

	Dent Control can help with your deductible in many cases. <a href = "/contact">Contact us</a> to learn more.</p>

	<h2 id = "q5" class = "tp-header">I got a cheaper estimate from someone else. Why is that?</h2>

	<p>Any shop can give a lower price by leaving something out or overlooking parts. Our
	
	technicians are &quotCraftmen&quot; and will do a good job of restoring your car at a fair
	
	price. Dent Control doesn’t intentionally leave anything out. Our mission is to give
	
	you a complete repair. Hail damage is estimated using an industry standard matrix.</p>

	<h2 id = "q6" class = "tp-header">Will dry ice pop the dents out?</h2>
	<p>Dry ice will not repair a dent on sheet metal. Period. It will, however warp the metal beyond the point of repair with PDR. Usually, a panel that has had dry ice placed on it will have to be replaced.</p>
	<a href = "#top-faq"><p>Back to Questions</p></a>

	<h2 id = "q7" class = "tp-header">Heat from the sun will remove the dent</h2>
	<p>Hail damage can only be removed using PDR or conventional paint and body. Dents will not “pop” themselves out.</p>
	<a href = "#top-faq"><p>Back to Questions</p></a>

	<h2 id = "q8" class = "tp-header">PDR looks easy. I can just push it out myself.</h2>
	<p>Without the proper training and practice, PDR should not be done by anyone. Irreparable damage can be done to your vehicle. Definitely don’t try this at home! All Dent Control technicians must pass a rigorous training, testing and inspection period prior to working on customers’ vehicles. You can always be assured that your car is in good hands with Dent Control.</p>
	<a href = "#top-faq"><p>Back to Questions</p></a>

	<h2 id = "q9" class = "tp-header">Will PDR damage my paint?</h2>
	<p>It is possible to crack paint when performing PDR. This is one reason only certified technicians should work on your car. Dent Control certifies all technicians prior to allowing them to work on your vehicle. We take every precaution to ensure your finish is not damaged. Dent Control warrants against damage to your paint.</p>
	<a href = "#top-faq"><p>Back to Questions</p></a>

	<h2 id = "q10" class = "tp-header">What if my paint was cracked when the dent was made?</h2>
	<p>Sometimes, when the dent is made, the paint will crack and peel. Depending on the amount of damage to the paint PDR may still be the way to go. Dent Control will touch up and clear coat smaller cracks in your paint to prevent additional peeling or corrosion. If the damage is too bad for this process, your Dent Control representative will point out the damage and let you make an informed decision.</p>

	<h2 id = "q11" class = "tp-header">Heat from the sun will remove the dent</h2>
	<p>Hail damage can only be removed using PDR or conventional paint and body. Dents will not “pop” themselves out.</p>
	<a href = "#top-faq"><p>Back to Questions</p></a>

	<h2 id = "q12" class = "tp-header">How is PDR estimated?</h2>
	<p>Your estimate is based on 3 main factors:<br>
	1. Quantity of dents per panel<br>
	2. Average size of the dents<br>
	3. Location of the dents and difficulty in accessing them.</p><br>
	<a href = "#top-faq"><p>Back to Questions</p></a>

	<h2 id = "q13" class = "tp-header">How is PDR actually done?</h2>
	<p>PDR is a very tedious process. Using the specialized tools, a PDR Technician pushes the dents out from the backside of the metal. Even the smallest dents (1/4” Diameter) require several push points to completely remove the dent. Dent Control Certified Master Technicians must pass a rigorous training, testing and inspection period prior to working on customers’ vehicles. You can always be assured that your car is in good hands with Dent Control. Only after stringent process of quality inspections can a technician work on your car. Come by one of our locations for a free demonstration.</p>

	<h2 id = "q14" class = "tp-header">What if I do not have my vehicle repaired?</h2>
	<p>If you make a claim with your insurance and do not have the damage repaired, your insurance company is not responsible for repairs next time your car is damaged by hail. In addition, the amount of damage done by hail will be deducted from any future damage such as a collision on say a fender or door. In some states it is illegal to make a claim and not have the repairs done. Check your local laws for more information.</p>
