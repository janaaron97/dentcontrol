	<h2 class = "tp-header">Will dry ice pop the dents out?</h2>
	<p>Dry ice will not repair a dent on sheet metal. Period. It will, however warp the metal beyond the point of repair with PDR. Usually, a panel that has had dry ice placed on it will have to be replaced.</p>

	<h2 class = "tp-header">Heat from the sun will remove the dent</h2>
	<p>Hail damage can only be removed using PDR or conventional paint and body. Dents will not “pop” themselves out.</p>

	<h2 class = "tp-header">PDR looks easy. I can just push it out myself.</h2>
	<p>Without the proper training and practice, PDR should not be done by anyone. Irreparable damage can be done to your vehicle. Definitely don’t try this at home! All Dent Control technicians must pass a rigorous training, testing and inspection period prior to working on customers’ vehicles. You can always be assured that your car is in good hands with Dent Control.</p>

	<h2 class = "tp-header">Will PDR damage my paint?</h2>
	<p>It is possible to crack paint when performing PDR. This is one reason only certified technicians should work on your car. Dent Control certifies all technicians prior to allowing them to work on your vehicle. We take every precaution to ensure your finish is not damaged. Dent Control warrants against damage to your paint.</p>

	<h2 class = "tp-header">What if my paint was cracked when the dent was made?</h2>
	<p>Sometimes, when the dent is made, the paint will crack and peel. Depending on the amount of damage to the paint PDR may still be the way to go. Dent Control will touch up and clear coat smaller cracks in your paint to prevent additional peeling or corrosion. If the damage is too bad for this process, your Dent Control representative will point out the damage and let you make an informed decision.</p>

	<p>Hail damage can only be removed using PDR or conventional paint and body. Dents will not “pop” themselves out.</p>

	<h2 class = "tp-header">How is PDR estimated?</h2>
	<p>Your estimate is based on 3 main factors:<br>
	1. Quantity of dents per panel<br>
	2. Average size of the dents<br>
	3. Location of the dents and difficulty in accessing them.</p>

	<h2 class = "tp-header">How is PDR actually done?</h2>
	<p>PDR is a very tedious process. Using the specialized tools, a PDR Technician pushes the dents out from the backside of the metal. Even the smallest dents (1/4” Diameter) require several push points to completely remove the dent. Dent Control Certified Master Technicians must pass a rigorous training, testing and inspection period prior to working on customers’ vehicles. You can always be assured that your car is in good hands with Dent Control. Only after stringent process of quality inspections can a technician work on your car. Come by one of our locations for a free demonstration.</p>

	<h2 class = "tp-header">What if I do not have my vehicle repaired?</h2>
	<p>If you make a claim with your insurance and do not have the damage repaired, your insurance company is not responsible for repairs next time your car is damaged by hail. In addition, the amount of damage done by hail will be deducted from any future damage such as a collision on say a fender or door. In some states it is illegal to make a claim and not have the repairs done. Check your local laws for more information.</p>
