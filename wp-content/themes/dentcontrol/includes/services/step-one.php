            <p>Call your insurance company and inform them that you have hail damage. In most cases, your insurance company will want to inspect the vehicle and write an initial estimate. Keep in mind that this is a quick estimate to confirm that there’s hail damage on your vehicle. This just gets the process started. We like to call this a “guestimate” because they are rarely accurate.</p>
