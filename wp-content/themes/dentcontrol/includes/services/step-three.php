            <p>Call Dent control to schedule a repair. When you drop off your vehicle, Dent Control will immediately wash your vehicle and perform a detailed inspection. This process takes several hours. Once the detailed estimate is complete, we compare it to your insurance estimate. More times than not, we need to contact your insurance company to file <a href = "faq/#q2">a supplement.</a> This “supplement” is the difference in cost between the insurance’s initial estimate and our detailed estimate. Dent Control will handle the process for you start to finish. Dent Control will repair your vehicle back to original condition. We typically not only repair the hail damage on your car, but most door dings and light damage. We promise your car will look better than it did before the storm!</p>
