				<p class = "tp-text">
					Paintless Dent Repair (or PDR) is a method of removing dents from the sheet metal of a vehicle, using specialized tools, without the use of paint, bondo or “traditional” body work.

					PDR has been the preferred method of repairing door dings, dents and hail damage with new car dealers for the last 15 to 20 years. Insurance companies have found it to be a superior alternative to repair small dents.

					If possible, it is always better to keep the factory paint on your vehicle. Your factory paint is always better than paint from a body shop. The adhesion properties, texture, color, tint and fading are near impossible to match with 100% precision. Some of the best body shops in town spend up to $100k on a paint booth. The auto manufacturer spends over $1million in most cases.
